https://www.rodneybeede.com/Building_Apache_2_4_for_Linux_with_mod_ssl.html

These are my instructions for building Apache 2.4 on Linux and including mod_ssl. OpenSSL is assumed to be available already and is thus not compiled from source.
Platform Versions used:

Apache 2.4.12 - http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi#apache24
Apache APR 1.5 - http://apr.apache.org/download.cgi
Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS, Server Edition, 32-bit - http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server
Ubuntu Hashes
Assumed that you have done all the latest apt-get upgrade
Prerequisites:

Read over the Apache Compiling and Installing documentation
It is assumed that OpenSSL 1.0.1 (or later) is already installed, but not necessarily the dev library package
It is assumed that Perl 5.14 (or later) is already installed
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
This avoids the "checking for OpenSSL version >= 0.9.7... FAILED" and "configure: WARNING: OpenSSL version is too old" errors on Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install libpcre3-dev
sudo apt-get install gcc make
You will need the source for the APR and APR-Util. Steps for download and install provided later
You are building using a non-privileged account (i.e. not root) and installing with sudo capability
Build:

Download version from http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi
Verify the integrity via the official hash from https://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.4.##.tar.bz2.sha1
sha1sum --check httpd-2.4.##.tar.bz2.sha1
tar -xf httpd-2.4.7.tar.bz2
Don't cd into httpd-2.4.7/ yet
wget http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/apache/apr/apr-1.5.1.tar.bz2
wget https://www.apache.org/dist/apr/apr-1.5.1.tar.bz2.md5
md5sum --check apr-1.5.1.tar.bz2.md5
wget http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/apache/apr/apr-util-1.5.4.tar.bz2
wget https://www.apache.org/dist/apr/apr-util-1.5.4.tar.bz2.md5
md5sum --check apr-util-1.5.4.tar.bz2.md5
tar -xf apr-1.5.1.tar.bz2 -C httpd-2.4.12/srclib/
mv httpd-2.4.12/srclib/apr-1.5.1/ httpd-2.4.12/srclib/apr
tar -xf apr-util-1.5.4.tar.bz2 -C httpd-2.4.12/srclib/
mv httpd-2.4.12/srclib/apr-util-1.5.4/ httpd-2.4.12/srclib/apr-util
cd httpd-2.4.12/
./configure --with-included-apr --sbindir=/usr/local/apache2/sbin --enable-ssl=shared --enable-mods-shared=all
Note that --enable-so is no longer required in Apache 2.4 as it gets auto-included
--with-included-apr (Uses downloaded APR for building)
--sbindir=/usr/local/apache2/sbin
Fixes bug in Apache 2.4.0-2.4.12 (possibly later) where default config.layout uses /bin instead of /sbin
Bug 56250 - sbindir in config.layout for Apache has bin instead of sbin
--enable-ssl=shared (Ensures mod_ssl is included)
--enable-mods-shared=all (Adds loadable modules for almost everything)
make
For installing all the parts see the "Install" section
Install:

sudo make install
You now have an installed build for your platform
Note: If you built on a 64-bit platform the build by default works only on 64-bit platforms
Fix Security Permissions:

Because the build process and make install doesn't always set an appropriate owner, group membership, or permission on files copied into the install directory you should always verify the appropriate security permissions.
sudo chown -R root:root /usr/local/apache2/
sudo chmod -R go-rwx /usr/local/apache2/
sudo chmod -R a-w /usr/local/apache2/
sudo chmod o+x /usr/local/apache2/
sudo chgrp daemon /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
sudo chmod g+x /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
sudo chmod -R g+r /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
sudo chgrp daemon /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/
sudo chmod g+x /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/
sudo chmod -R g+r /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin/
sudo chmod -R u+w /usr/local/apache2/conf/ /usr/local/apache2/logs/
You will need to adjust other permissions according to the features you use for your Apache server.

Re-package options:

You could simply tarball the directory or you could use something like checkinstall to easily create a distro package. You could also roll your own distro flavor package that includes package metadata like description, size, and dependencies.
PHP 5.5 Addition:

You will probably want to also include your own build of PHP with some extensions like zlib.

Download PHP (https://php.net/downloads.php)
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libpng-dev libjpeg-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libbz2-dev
Compile with common needed options for PHP with Apache and MySQL
./configure \
	--with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs \
	--with-mysql \
	--with-zlib \
	--with-gd \
	--with-jpeg-dir \
	--with-png-dir \
	--with-openssl \
	--with-pcre-regex \
	--with-bz2 \
	--enable-calendar \
	--with-curl \
	--enable-exif \
	--with-imap-ssl \
	--enable-zip \
	--prefix=/usr/local/php5
You use --prefix=PREFIX if you want it somewhere other than /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, etc.
Compile and install with the usual (make && make install)
For Apache you need to put the libphp5.so (it links to your PHP compiled prefix) into your apache2/modules folder
